## process stewardship instead of of data stewardship

* there is only one thing anyone needs to know about data: **how the data was produced**
* result of data production may cary additional information 

Sometimes, open data are sufficient.
Open workflows allow:
* repeat the analysis exactly
* repeat the analysis with changes - reproduce, scrutinize
* induce provenance metadata to the resulting data
* make data converters
