# OW-vs-OD
## process stewardship instead of of data stewardship

* there is only one thing anyone needs to know about the data: **how the data was produced**. Since everything about the data derives from the way it was made.
  * for example, we know that we are measuring the 20-80 keV flux of Crab pulsar, averaged over 2021.
* **this is not true**, since the result of data production may contain important additional information - **something new is learned from the outcome**
  * for example, we did not know that the said flux was that many ergscm2 

Some results can only be qualified by the outcome, not by process.
E.g. detection. Or impact (citations).
The outcome should be partially predictable by the process. 
**Partial predictability of the outcome by process is the cornerstone principle of science.**

* Computing OW produces new relations. We can describe them in odakb
* OW is described as function, and is sufficient to predict new features somewhat
* Structure of G can be used to explain

Sometimes, open data are sufficient.
Open workflows allow:
* repeat the analysis exactly
* repeat the analysis with changes - reproduce, scrutinize
* induce provenance metadata to the resulting data
* make data converters
